Welcome to gmuck!

  gmuck assists you in generating valid (X)HTML by examining the
  source code that generates it.

  It is not a replacement for real validation tools, but is handy in
  quick checks and in situations where validation of the actual markup
  is troublesome.

  gmuck is a line-oriented tool.  Because of that and other fundamental
  reasons, it will not check the structure of your markup.  One could
  say that it works on markup element level.

  There are two main components, the "HTML::GMUCK" module and the
  "gmuck" command line interface.

  gmuck is short for Generated MarkUp ChecKer, or Generated MUCK if you
  like.

  See the gmuck(1) and HTML::GMUCK(3) manual pages
  (or "perldoc docs/gmuck.pod" and "perldoc docs/HTML-GMUCK.pod" before
  installation), and ChangeLog, TODO and BUGS files for more information.


DEPENDENCIES

  gmuck should work with Perl 5.00503 and later.  The development and
  most of the testing is done with Perl 5.6.1 on Linux.
  If you encounter problems,  please report them, preferably with a
  suggested fix (see FEEDBACK).

  gmuck is written in pure Perl, so no C requirements.  Also, all
  platforms that Perl works on should be supported.

  HTML::Tagset (version 3.03 or newer) is strongly recommended, though
  not required.  Most tests depend on it, if you don't have it, you will
  receive no messages from those tests.

  Regex::PreSuf (version 1.15 or newer) is recommended, systems with it
  will see a slight performance gain in most checks.


INSTALLATION

   Installation goes the normal way:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


AVAILABILITY

  gmuck's home page is at <http://gmuck.sourceforge.net/>.
  CPAN, <http://www.cpan.org/> should also have the latest version.


FEEDBACK
